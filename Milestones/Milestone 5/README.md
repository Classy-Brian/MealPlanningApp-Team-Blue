# High Fidelity Design 

Overview

This report outlines the rationale behind the high-fidelity prototype of Byte Me, a mobile application designed to streamline meal planning while minimizing food waste. Building upon insights gained from user research and low-fidelity prototyping, this high-fidelity iteration represents a significant step toward delivering a user-centric solution that enhances meal management. This document will highlight how the design addresses user needs and pain points identified in the research phase, emphasizing key improvements implemented since the low-fidelity prototype. Additionally, we will provide a clear justification for each design choice and its intended impact.

User Needs and Requirements

Recap of User Research
The high-fidelity prototype of Byte Me is designed with a strong foundation in user research, which identified several key challenges:

- Food Waste: Many users admitted to wasting food due to ineffective meal planning, often purchasing duplicate ingredients or failing to use items before expiration.

- Time Constraints: Users expressed difficulty in dedicating time to meal planning, particularly during busy workweeks, highlighting the need for a quick and efficient solution.

- Allergy-Based Features: Users with dietary restrictions wanted a simple way to find safe and suitable recipes.

- Visual Goals: Users sought visual tools to track progress toward healthier eating habits.

- Recipe Inspiration: Many users struggled with meal variety, often defaulting to familiar dishes rather than discovering new recipes.

Addressing User Needs
The high-fidelity design of Byte Me incorporates the following features to directly tackle these issues:

- Reduced Food Waste: The standalone pantry management feature helps users track available ingredients, preventing unnecessary purchases and encouraging ingredient utilization before expiration. The app also suggests recipes based on pantry items.

- Efficient Grocery Shopping: An automatically generated grocery list ensures users purchase only what is necessary, improving shopping efficiency.

- Filterable Recipe Suggestions: Users can filter recipes based on allergies or disliked ingredients, making searches more tailored and less stressful.

- Goal Tracking: A visual progress tracker allows users to monitor their calorie intake and track achievements such as trying new recipes.

Design Rationale and Improvements

Navigation:
In response to user feedback, we expanded the navigation bar from four to five tabs, separating the pantry feature from the grocery list for easier access. Since pantry management is central to reducing food waste, its prominence improves usability. Additionally, the navigation bar is removed from profile and settings screens to reduce clutter and improve focus.

Home Page:
The home page retains its core function of providing quick access to meal plans and recipe suggestions. Recipe suggestions remain at the top to inspire variety, while the structured meal plan displays scheduled meals and calorie counts. While the layout is similar to the low-fidelity prototype, design refinements improve its clarity and visual appeal.

Recipe Search and Display:
The recipe page has been centered in the navigation, reinforcing its importance. Users can now filter saved recipes by calorie count and category, improving meal selection efficiency. We removed the discovery section at the top to avoid redundancy, as the home page already serves this purpose.

Meal Planner (Calendar):
The calendar page now displays meal plans only for days that users have actively scheduled meals. This modification declutters the interface and makes relevant information more accessible. An "Add" button enables quick entry of new meal plans, streamlining the planning process.

Grocery List:
By removing the pantry from this section, we improved usability and reinforced the pantry’s significance. Search functionality was added to simplify ingredient lookup, and users can add items via a plus icon, mirroring the recipe tab’s search mechanism.

Pantry Management:
Now a dedicated tab, the pantry helps users keep track of owned ingredients and suggests recipes based on available items. This redesign encourages ingredient utilization, directly addressing food waste concerns.

Visual Design and Branding:
Our design prominently features blue, inspired by our team name, “Team Blue,” and its general appeal. Icons enhance usability by making information instantly recognizable (e.g., a moon icon for nighttime meals, ingredient images in grocery lists). The name "Byte Me" cleverly combines “byte” (a nod to our computer science background) and “bite” (referencing meal planning).

Conclusion:
The high-fidelity prototype of Byte Me represents a substantial improvement over the initial design, incorporating user feedback to create a more seamless meal planning experience. Our focus on pantry management, enhanced grocery lists, and a visually appealing yet functional interface demonstrates our commitment to user-centered design. This prototype lays the groundwork for further usability testing and refinements as we transition into development.
