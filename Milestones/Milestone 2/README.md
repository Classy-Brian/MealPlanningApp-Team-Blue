# Milestone 2: User-Centered Activities 

Introduction

Understanding users, their behavior, their needs, and their preferences are all key aspects of designing an application tailored to them. To visualize the target users of our meal planning application, Team Blue conducted user interviews, created personas based on interview analysis, and developed use case scenarios to refine our application.

User Interviews

Objective:
The goal of the user interviews was to better understand users’ needs and preferences regarding a meal planning app. Based on feedback from Milestone 1, we reduced the number of initially considered features. These interviews helped us gather feedback on essential features and refine the app’s design.

Methodology:
Our team conducted 15 structured interviews, targeting individuals likely to use a meal planning application. We visited locations such as grocery stores and gyms to engage with health-conscious individuals who cook regularly. Additionally, we interviewed colleagues and co-workers with busy schedules. Interviews were conducted with participants' consent, and some were carried out electronically for convenience.

Participants

Key statistics from our interviews:

- 66% - In their 20s

- 46% - Have multiple commitments

- 26% - Have dependents

- 26% - Follow restricted meal plans

Analysis and Insights

Personal Information:
We collected data on users’ age, occupation, schedules, and experience with meal planning. Findings included:

- 73% have a busy schedule

- 27% have done meal planning at least once

Meal Planning Goals and Challenges

Key goals:

- 80% prefer variety in meal plans

- 93% use meal planning to save money

- 93% aim to eat healthier

- 80% want to reduce food waste

- 67% want to reduce stress in meal planning

- 40% want quick answers to “What’s for dinner?”

Challenges include time constraints, balancing convenience with variety, and lack of nutritional knowledge.

App Feature Preferences

Key insights:

- 86.7% want pre-made meal plans

- 93.3% prefer allergy-based suggestions

- 22.2% want recipe assistance and new recipe discovery

- 20.6% seek visual goal tracking for healthier eating

- 19% want a social feed; 15.9% want group-based suggestions

Despite initial assumptions, social features were the least desired. As a result, we pivoted to focus on meal plans for individuals and removed the social feed feature. This ensures better development time allocation and a more refined user experience.

Health Consciousness and Cooking

- 22.7% struggle to balance dietary preferences in their households

- 25% already engage in pre-meal planning

- 20.5% want to improve cooking skills

- 31.8% want meal suggestions catering to allergies or sensitivities

We will incorporate dietary restriction filtering and allow users to exclude disliked ingredients for a more personalized experience.

Pricing Model

- 71.4% prefer a free version with limited features

- 73.3% dislike ads

To meet these preferences, we will design a free version with core features while minimizing disruptive ads.

Persona Development

Based on our findings, we created personas representing key user behaviors, preferences, and needs, which help guide our design decisions.

Use Cases

We developed scenarios demonstrating how users might interact with the app:

- Create a Weekly Meal Plan

- Select meals for each day

- Customize meals based on preferences/restrictions

- Receive meal suggestions

- Track nutritional goals

- Plan meals for multiple people (e.g., children)

- Search for meals that fit within a specific time frame

- Utilize “prep once, eat all week” meal plans

These insights will guide our development, ensuring an effective and user-friendly meal planning application tailored to individual needs.
